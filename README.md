# BrokenTable

BrokenTable is a restaurant reservation application inspired by [Resy](https://resy.com) and [OpenTable](https://opentable.com). It is built on React/Redux, Ruby on Rails, and a PostgreSQL database.

BrokenTable is unique in that it pairs your party with another party in one combined table.
